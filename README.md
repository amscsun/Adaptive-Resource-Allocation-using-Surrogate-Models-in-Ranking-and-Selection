# Adaptive-Resource-Allocation-using-Surrogate-Models-in-Ranking-and-Selection

This is the code for "Dynamics Resource Allocation via Objective Function Approximation"

1. The approximation of objective function using least squares approach used the interative update technique to avoid inverse of matrix

2. Simulation code for the numerical Examples, queueing systems and inventory systems, are also included

3. The animation.gif demonstrates how adaptive selection is conducted in the queueing example. At each step, the algorithm makes its decision based on the local information, and the approximate objective function.
